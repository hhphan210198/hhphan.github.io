        		<p>
        			I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Machine Learning at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. After receiving my Bachelor's degree also from UMass, I was very fortunate to receive the Bay State Fellowship to continue my education.
        			<br />
        			My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with an emphasis on robust models that are capable of learning with noisy labels and/or limited data. I also enjoy learning web development as a hobby.
