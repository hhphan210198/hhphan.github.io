                        During the summer of 2019, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at <a href="http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/">SLANG Lab</a> at UMass 
                        under the mentorship of Professor <a href="http://brenocon.com/">Brendan O'Connor</a> and PhD Student <a href="https://kakeith.github.io/">Katherine
                        Keith</a>. My work focuses on the problem of prevalence estimation in unlabeled data in low-resource settings, and is an extension of Prof.O'Connor
                        and K.Keith's <a href="">Uncertainty-aware generative models for inferring document class prevalence</a>. Within my project, I build deep learning sentiment classifiers using
                        <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/pubs/2015_acl_dan.pdf">Deep Averaging Network (DAN) architecture</a>. We want to identify if there is a linear relationship 
                        between the classifiers' performances in the task sentiment classification (measured by accuracy and cross-entropy loss) and their performances in the task of prevalence estimation 
                        (measured by mean absolute error). We also want to identify important hyper-parameters of DAN in order to build efficient real-world prevalence estimators.
